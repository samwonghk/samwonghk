### About Me
In the last years, I got involved in various projects of geospatial and tabular data management.
I was responsible for the project management, system development and data manipulation.
I had deep experience with spatial and non-spatial system development with database.
I used programming languages like Python, C#, Java, JavaScript and HTML etc. in my work.
I also developed some programs and scripts and even a screen saver for leisure.
